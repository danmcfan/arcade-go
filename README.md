# Arcade Go

Navigate to [https://danmcfan.github.io/arcade-go/](https://danmcfan.github.io/arcade-go/) to play the games.

This project is built using Go and leverages WebAssembly (WASM) to run the games directly in your web browser. The Go code is compiled to WebAssembly, allowing it to communicate with the browser's JavaScript runtime. This enables seamless handling of user input and rendering of the games through the browser's canvas API, providing a smooth gaming experience without requiring any additional plugins or installations.

## Snake

A classic arcade game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats apples. The challenge is to navigate the snake around the screen without hitting the walls or your own tail. The game gets progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer.

## Pong

One of the earliest arcade games, Pong is a simple two-player tennis-style game. Players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to make your opponent miss the ball to score points.
